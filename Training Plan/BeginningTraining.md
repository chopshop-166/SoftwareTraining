  - `while` loop syntax
    - Simple guessing game, ask user for number until it matches
    - Explain infinite loop as basis of robot control
 - [ ] Averaging Robot exercise
  - Add averaging to driver input
  - This is a Low Pass Filter

 ### Projects
- [ ] Create console programs / Review
  - Write a 2 function calculator
  - Write a 4 function calculator (Advanced)
## Fourth Week:
- Git, git etiquette, and how to run robot code
Workflow and bug fixing (TEACH BRANCHING IN PREP FOR FUNCTIONS)
((( (- [ ] Averaging Robot exercise
  - Add averaging to driver input
  - This is a Low Pass Filter
  - Explore how increasing the window size (# of samples) slows response
- deadbanding ))))
FUNCTIONS
 - Way of encapsulating code that is re-used
    - 3 Components
      - Type
      - Name
      - Parameters
  - Explore existing functions in subsystem
    - Command function (returns a command)
    - Ask students to identify other functions
  - Robot Examples
    - Move deadband code into a function
    - Create function that finds average of an array (replace averaging code from previous session)
  - Console Examples
    - Square function
    - Min function
    - Max function


 ### Projects
     - Revisit other projects and rewrite the code to make it shorter (Calculator)


## Fifth Week:
 - [ ] Classes
  - Hold information (Member variables) and functionality (methods) that are related
  - We've already seen classes
    - Subsystem is a class
    - Commands are a class
  - Cover syntax
    - `public class Name {}`
    - Constructor, has the same name as the class
    - Member variables go at the top of the class
    - Methods go at the end, after member variables
    - Motor Class
      - What do we control about motors?
      - Values [-1,1]
      - Getters / Setters
      - Stop convenience feature

 ### Projects
  - Demonstrate motors on offaxis

## Sixth Week:
 - [ ] Inheritance
  - Classes `extend` other classes
  - Used to consolidate shared information/functionality
  - Extensions can add new functionality
  - Replace existing functionality
  - MotorGroup class
      - Has 2+ motors
      - Implement same functions as Motor
      - Add `getAverageSpeed()`
      - Arrays!
      - Variadic arguments
      - For loops!
  - `Drivetrain` class
      - Left and Right `Motor`
      - Following WPILib model
      - Show usage with different combinations of `Motor` and `MotorGroup`
  ### Projects
   - Bring robot back out and code imputs
## Seventh Week:
  - Explore classes used so far
  - Subsystem
  - Drive
  - SpeedController
 - [ ] Interfaces
  - Defines what methods a class has
  - A class `implements` an interface or interfaces
  - Drive Subsystem interface in robot map
    - Add interface definition
    - Fill in behavior in custom robot map
    - Get value from robot map in Drive Subsystem
 ### Projects
  - Make mock subsystem
## Eighth Week:
 - Interest splits: Auto, drivetrain, arm, LEDs
 ### Projects
  - Basic subsystem with mock motors and sensors
## Ninth Week:
 - Interest splits: Auto, drivetrain, arm, LEDs
 ### Projects
  - Basic subsystem with mock motors and sensors
## Tenth Week:
 - Interest splits: Auto, drivetrain, arm, LEDs
 ### Projects
  - Basic subsystem with mock motors and sensors

## Filler Material
For when the going gets tough and there isn't enough material to fill the tim
 - [ ] Cover GIT
  - If there's extra time, now is a good opportunity to cover GIT
  - [Software Roll Call](https://github.com/chopshop-166/SoftwareRollCall)
    1. Clone repository
    1. Create branch off of master
    1. Add name to YEAR.txt
    1. Commit change
    1. Push change
    1. Open PR
    1. Ask fellow student to review PR
    1. Ask mentor to merge PR
 - [ ] Enums
  - Creates a new variable type that has limited named values
  - Example Lift heights for elevator
  - Example State of arm (stowed, pickup, scoring)
 - [ ] Switch
  - Use instead of series of `if` when looking at single variable
 - [ ] Annotations
  - Used to add information about code inside the code
  - They can be extended with custom behavior
  - Explore the usage of the `RobotMapFor("MAC ADDRESS")` annotation in the robot map
 - [ ] [Collections](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.base/java/util/Collections.html)
  - Provide a way of holding multiple objects with a standard API
  - Tie into for loop discussion (`Iterable`)
